The files for lab 02 will be located in labs/02 folder. Then we want to install the dependencies

#### Insights/Results
I've learned how to create a login system using passport js. It was very challenging at first because I had to understand how passport js was working in order to configure it properly. I wanted to create a calculate field on mongodb but the expression kept resulting in errors.
