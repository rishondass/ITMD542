#### Insights/Results
I've learned how to create a basic CRUD application. Some of the challenges were not using libraries and doing everything from scratch took a lot longer than expected. Something I couldn't get working was editing the information on the main page without having to change pages. The work around for this was that I created another page for the editing of the information.
